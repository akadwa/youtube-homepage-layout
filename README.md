# YouTube Homepage Layout Design

This project is a recreation of the YouTube homepage layout using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to strengthen my knowledge of HTML and CSS by applying it to a real-world design.

- The header includes the YouTube logo, search bar, and navigation links.
